# HTML Structure Project

## üìú Overview

This project involves crafting a webpage using only HTML, based on a provided Figma design. The objective is to establish a robust and semantic HTML structure. This stage focuses solely on HTML; no CSS or JavaScript is involved.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### Directory Layout

- **`index.html`**: The primary HTML file containing the complete webpage structure.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing project details, instructions, and guidance.

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file is organized into the following sections:

1. **Header**
2. **Banner**
3. **Quote**
4. **Videos**
5. **Membership**
6. **FAQ**
7. **Footer**

## ‚úÖ Validation

Ensure the HTML code is W3C compliant by validating it with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

## üé® Design Reference

The design for this project is available on Figma. Access the design file [here](https://www.figma.com/design/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?node-id=3558-0&t=ZZqbOOffJ72sK9M2-0) and align the HTML structure with the provided wireframe.

## üìù Notes

- **Accessibility**: Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes.
- **Design Accuracy**: Review the Figma design to ensure precise replication.
- **Semantic HTML**: Follow best practices for semantic HTML for proper structure and accessibility.
